Total hacky prototype at the moment. YYMV.

Steps:
* Clone m-c, check out the stylo branch (this one).
* Add this to your .mozconfig:
  ac_add_options --disable-rust
  ac_add_options --enable-macos-target=10.7
  CPPFLAGS=-DMOZ_STYLO
* Clone servo, check out the stylo branch.
* Clone https://github.com/bholley/rust-selectors, check out the stylo branch.
* Set up a .cargo/config override for rust-selectors.
* Build servo as release-mode geckolib (./mach build-geckolib -r). Debug also works, you'll just need
  to modify the path in moz.build a bit more.
* Set up the absolute path in m-c's |toolkit/library/moz.build| to point to your servo build directory.
* Set up the absolute path in servo/ports/geckolib/glue.rs to point to the appropriate resources directory.
* Build m-c.
